# moon

moon is a public repository that I use to train my Python skills. 

Starting from the awareness that it is by explaning that one learns to a deeper level what they tested, I'm making this repository a place where I grow my skills by trying to explain to others my thought process. 

The repo is growing and the structure might change with time. At the moment there are:
- Learning For Loops: a jupyter notebook with a list of challenges that I am solving which guide me from easy to more complex for loops
- Learning Numpy: a jupyter notebook to learn the basics and not-so-basics of numpy arrays operations
- other challenges
